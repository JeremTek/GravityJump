# GravityJump
This is the result of my participation in the LameJam 14 on Itch.io. The theme was gravity and I made it in 3 days. 12 levels, a lot of different mechanic, groovy music, there's everything you need to have fun.
Warning : it's pretty hard! (and it's a bit ugly : it was a LameJam after all)

Download the .rar and just use the .exe
The .rar version works on Windows only

If you want to play on another OS or don't want to download the file, check the game on Itch.io at https://jyrux.itch.io/lamejam14-gravityjump
Don't forget to post a comment as that would be greatly appreciated.
